Delete Alternate Nodes
Difficulty: EasyAccuracy: 56.09%Submissions: 65K+Points: 2
Given a Singly Linked List, Delete all alternate nodes of the list ie delete all the nodes present in even positions.

Examples :

Input: LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6
 
Output: 1->3->5

Explanation: Deleting alternate nodes ie 2, 4, 6 results in the linked list with elements 1->3->5.
Input: LinkedList: 99->59->42->20
 
Output: 99->42
 
Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)

Constraints:
1 <= number of nodes <= 105
1 <= node->data <= 103
